subtitle: Why I'm writing this blog...

Hi, I'm Kevin and I'm currently in the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program in SF.

#### Why data science?
I've always been drawn to numbers whether it was studying them in math classes growing up, pouring over sports statistics of my favorite teams and players, or calculating probabilities and expected values at the poker table.

#### Why a blog?
Because we were strongly encouraged to do so!  But seriously, it's a great outlet to formulate and organize my thoughts even if I'm the only one reading them.

#### Interests
- Web technology
- Investment management
- Bay Area sports teams (Giants, Warriors, Sharks, 49ers)
- Hip-hop and salsa dance
- The usual: movies, TV, video games
