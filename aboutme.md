Hi, I'm Kevin and I'm currently in the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program in SF.

#### Why data science?
I've always been drawn to numbers whether it was studying them in math classes growing up, pouring over sports statistics of my favorite teams and players, or calculating probabilities and expected values at the poker table.

Data science just seems like a great fit for my interests and my background.  Storytelling through numbers, and making business decisions driven by data.

#### Why a blog?
Because we were strongly encouraged to do so!  But seriously, it's a great outlet to formulate and organize my thoughts even if I'm the only one reading them.  It's also given me a chance to catch up on some of the cool blogging/publishing stuff out there or being developed.

#### Interests
- Web technology/products
- Investments/stock market performance
- Bay Area sports teams (Giants, Warriors, Sharks, and 49ers)
- Playing sports
- Hip-hop and salsa dance
- The usual: movies, TV, video games, music
