FIRST!

This is basically a post to try out some Markdown functionality with Github Pages, Jekyll, and redcarpet (Markdown processing library) implemented.  Redcarpet seems to work great with with code blocks, but I ran into quite a bit of trouble trying to get MathJax to output correctly.  Essentially, redcarpet ignores the MathJax delimiters ($ and $$) and just parses everything in between.

I did find a workaround to incase the MathJax equations in a div tag so that redcarpet ignores it completely.  This works for MathJax equations in its own line, but does not work for inline.  Still have not found an elegant solution for that.

**_Not_** that **difficult**.  ~~Just Kidding~~.
