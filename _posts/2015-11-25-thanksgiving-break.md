So, it's Thanksgiving break and I'm pretty sure we all need the time off.  Of course, this blog has been completely abandoned over the past few weeks, but there's still a small resemblance of hope that I will update it on a more consistent basis, preferably with more actual data science content.  It still feels that we just started the program, but you look up and we're over halfway done with the structured cirriculum already and rapidly approaching capstone project time.  We've gone through an avalanche of concepts, formulas, tests, models, and strategies in a very short amount of time, so it will take some time to consolidate all we've learned.  For me, it's been a struggle at times without any actual experience working with Python or R coming into this program, but I've embraced the challenge and it has been pretty rewarding.  "Enjoy the process."
